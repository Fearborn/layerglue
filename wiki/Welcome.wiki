= Welcome to the !LayerGlue !ActionScript library =

LayerGlue is a fully featured ActionScript 3 library ranging from simple low level utility classes, multi-language substitution, and workflow enhancements, up to more prescriptive solutions for browser integration and application management.

== Example templates ==

For a quickstart guide, have a look through these example templates. They are currently built in Flex but do not require any of the Flex framework, so could easily be converted to Flash only applications.


=== [TemplateSubstitution 1. Substitution] ===

Simple multi-language substitution, allowing the loading of Excel files directly into flash.

=== [TemplateDeserialization 2. Deserialization] ===

Automated deserialization of xml into custom value object classes.

A combination of examples 1 and 2, substuting text and deserializing the results into  custom value objects.
