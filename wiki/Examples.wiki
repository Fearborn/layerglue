==Utility examples==

The library does not have to be used in it's entirety, and specific classes (or groups of classes) can be used independently. These examples demonstrate several important utilities, all of which can be used separately from the MVC navigation framework.

 # [TemplateSubstitution Substitution]
 # [TemplateDeserialization Deserialization]
 # [TemplateSubstitutionAndDeserialization Substitution and Deserialization]
 # [TemplateWorkflow Workflow]


==Navigation examples==

The key part of the library is a navigable MVC framework that supports browser integration. This means that sections of the site are deep-linkable, and navigation to and from these sections can be automated by the underlying system.
